      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><p>My name is Vlad, I'm 13 y/o and I live in a little village located in Romania (some people might know this).</p>
	    <p>I like tech and anime (kinda bad at coding) and idk much anime. In my free time I chat with my online friends in Telegram.</p>
      <p>Tbh, I'm not a perfect boy, I'm most a dumbass who mostly thinks before speaking. I also have some nervous issues and I'm angry on almost everything (but not all the time).</p>
      <p>In my family we are 6 siblings, my parents try the best to keeping us happy. My parents were aggressive before but now everything is fine.</p>
      <p>I admit that I do have fights with my friends (I lost friendship with a friend because of this, I never want to be their friend anymore.)</p>
      <p>Most of people hate me because I'm toxic. I feel sad sometimes because of this, but I try to keep myself strong and not care about their bad opinion of me!</p>
      <p>My family is not that rich like other families, my parents work hard for money, I can't afford much stuff online like other people.</p>
      <p>The thing I hate most in my life is school. All my male classmates hate me and term me "dumbass" and "retard", but I don't care even though they are super rude and they just use me. I mostly talk at school with my female classmates, they understand me better and we have many things in common.</p>
      <p>My favorite type of music is Pop and Electronic Music. My favourite pop artists are: Ariana Grande, Bille Eilish, and Doja Cat. My favorite electronic music artists are: Lensko, Tobu, and Vexento.</p>
      <p>Many people say that I put lies in my life story, but I actually don't. It's my life and I'm happy about it even though it's kinda bad, I don't care! It's my life, not someone else's!</p>

      And myea, that's all for now.
