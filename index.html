      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><p>My name is Vlad, im 13 y/o and i live in a little village located in Romania (some people might know this)</p>
	    <p>I like tech and anime (kinda trash at coding) and idk much anime.. im free time I talk with my online friends in tg</p>
      <p>Tbh, im not a perfect boy, im most a dumbass who most thinks before speaking.. I also have some nevers issues and im most angry on almost everything (but not all the time)</p>
      <p>In my family we are 6 siblings, my parents try the best making us happy, yeah my parents were aggressive before but now everything is fine</p>
      <p>I admit that i most make fights with my friends (I lost my friendship with one of my friends, I never want to be friend with them)</p>
      <p>Most of people hate me cuz im toxic, yeah I feel sad sometimes cause of this, but I try keeping strong and don't care about others opinion!</p>
      <p>My family is not that rich like other family's, my parents work hard for money, I cant afford much stuff on internet like other people..</p>
      <p>The most thing I hate in my life, is school, all my boy classmates hate me and call me dumbass and retard, but I don't pretty care, even though they are super very rude and they just use me, I most talk at school with my girl classmates, they understand me more better and we have many things in common with them..</p>
      <p>My favorite type of music is Pop and Electronic Music, my fav pop artists are: Ariana Grande, Bille Eilish, Doja Cat. And my favorite electronic music artists are: Lensko, Tobu, Vexento</p>
      <p>Many people say that I lie about my life story, but I actually don't, it's my real life, and im happy of my life, even though it's kinda bad life, I don't care!</p>

      And Myea, that's all for now..
